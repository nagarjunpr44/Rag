# Conversational AI with PDF Retrieval System

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that enables users to interact with PDF documents using conversational AI. It utilizes Langchain and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and processing.

## Key Features
- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files for processing.
- **Conversational Queries**: Ask questions related to the content of the uploaded PDFs.
- **Fast Retrieval**: Uses FAISS for quick access to document embeddings.
- **LLM Integration**: Leverages a large language model (LLaMA-2 via CTransformers) for accurate responses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Langchain
- FAISS
- Sentence-Transformers
- PyPDFLoader

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/conversational-pdf-retrieval
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd conversational-pdf-retrieval
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. Upload a PDF file using the provided interface.
2. Ask questions related to the content of the PDF.
3. Receive answers generated by the AI model based on the document's content.

## Notes
- Ensure your system has sufficient resources (CPU/GPU) to run the LLM model efficiently.
- The FAISS vector store is saved locally, allowing for faster queries on subsequent searches.
